# Random Color Generator App

This Flutter app is a simple mobile application that generates a random color and sets it as the background color of the screen. It's a fun and interactive way to explore different color combinations and create visually appealing backgrounds.

## Features

- **Random Color Generation**: With a single tap of a button, the app generates a completely random color.

- **Background Color Update**: The generated color is set as the background color of the screen, providing an immediate visual representation of the chosen color.

- **Hexadecimal Color Code**: The hexadecimal color code of the generated color is displayed on the screen, making it easy for users to replicate the color elsewhere.
